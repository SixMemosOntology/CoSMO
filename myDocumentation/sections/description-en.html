<span class="markdown">
  CoSMO (Calvino Six Memos Ontology) conceptualises the interpretive process outlined by Calvino in the first chapter "Lightness" of his “Six Memos for the Next Millennium”, 1985. The ontology can currently be used to make Calvino’s interpretation applicable to new unseen texts with the help of a user-friendly easy to use tool (https://mangiafrangette.github.io/extraction.html). We expect the ontology to be a starting point for further developments in the field of computational literary analysis.
