<h2 id="desc" class="list">CoSMO - Calvino's Six Memos Ontology: Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
<span class="markdown">
 <p>The classes of the ontology represent the fundamental concepts that led Calvino's critical analysis in the chapter "Lightness" from "Six Memos for the Next Millennium", namely "Lightness" and "Heaviness". They both have subclasses that explain some particular manifestations (for example, "Brightness" and "Movement" for "Lightness"). There are also classes to represent literary texts, fictional characters and rhetorical effects (like "Repetition", "Omission","Similarity"). 
<br>Example: cosmo:alba rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual ,
   <br>cosmo:Brightness ; </p>
<p>The object properties generally relate the classes between themselves specifying some kinds of relationships.
  <br>Example: cosmo:alba cosmo:hasSource cosmo:literaryText3 ;</p>
<p>Data properties are exploited to link the instances of the classes to the string textual reference.
<br>Example: cosmo:alba cosmo:TextualPart "s’apriva l’alba." ;</p> 
<p>We populated the ontology with individuals extracted from the following texts: La pioggia nel pineto, d'Annunzio; The Wind – tapped like a tired man, Dickinson; Hai viso di pietra scolpita, Pavese; Movesi il vecchierel canuto e bianco, Petrarca.</p>
